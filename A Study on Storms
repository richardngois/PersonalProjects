Data Visualization on Reported Storms
================
A Study by Richard Ngo
Dated: 10/18/2019

-----

In this study, I performed data manipulation and key data
visualization techniques on storm occurences from 2010 to 2015.

After compiling this data into one csv file, I worked with specific
storm attributes such as:

  - serial number
  - date of records
  - storm basins and subbasins
  - types of storm
  - latitude/longitude
  - wind speed
  - wind pressure

Using these attributes, we note several interesting facts that were discovered
during the analysis part of the workout. For most of my observations,
we refer to the output folder that contains a majority of our summary
statistics as well as compare theme to code/graphs created.

  - From my summary statistics, I can conclude that there are a total
    of ***578 unique storm*** names in these accumulating years. We can
    categorize which storms occurred in which part of the hemisphere
    with the follow code chunk:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
## north hemisphere storms
north_hem <- summarise(
  group_by( 
    filter(dat, Latitude > 0), Name))

nrow(north_hem) 
```

    ## [1] 361

``` r
## south hemisphere storms
south_hem <- summarise(
  group_by( 
    filter(dat, Latitude < 0), Name))

nrow(south_hem) 
```

    ## [1] 137

  - Likewise, we can also find ***which storms passed through the
    equator*** in a similar fashion:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
select(
  filter(
    summarise(
      group_by(
        rbind(north_hem, south_hem), Name), count = n()), count > 1), Name)
```

    ## # A tibble: 7 x 1
    ##   Name  
    ##   <chr> 
    ## 1 CARLOS
    ## 2 COLIN 
    ## 3 KATE  
    ## 4 PAUL  
    ## 5 SANDRA
    ## 6 SEAN  
    ## 7 TOMAS

  - In terms of storm records, 2010 holds the least amount with ***2787
    counts*** while 2015 holds the greatest amount with ***3810
    counts***. From our ***records-per-year*** text file, we also find
    that that amount of storm records increased upon each year.

  - From our ***data-summary*** text file, we find various findings on
    the storm positions (longitude, latitude), wind speeds, and pressure
    values. As an example, the maximum wind speed is shown to be ***185
    kt*** and the minimum pressure at ***872***. To check to see whether
    or not these values are true in addition to which storm name
    correlates to them, we may provide the following code chunk:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
## max wind speed
summarise(
  group_by(
    filter(na.omit(dat), `Wind(WMO)` == max(`Wind(WMO)`)), Name, `Wind(WMO)`))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2
    ## # Groups:   Name [1]
    ##   Name     `Wind(WMO)`
    ##   <chr>          <dbl>
    ## 1 PATRICIA         185

``` r
## min wind pressure
summarise(
  group_by(
    filter(na.omit(dat), `Pres(WMO)` == min(`Pres(WMO)`)), Name, `Pres(WMO)`))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2
    ## # Groups:   Name [1]
    ##   Name     `Pres(WMO)`
    ##   <chr>          <dbl>
    ## 1 PATRICIA         872

The following questions will be narratively answered as we take a look
at the graphs we observed from the data visualization portion of our
study:

  - **Do storms tend to occur uniformly throughout the year?**
  - **Are there months where there’s more storm activity?**
  - **Is there a particular Basin where storms occur more frequently?**
  - **Are there basins without much storm activity?**
  - **What is the correlation between wind speed and wind pressure?**

For the first two questions, let us refer to this barchart of the storm
record counts held in each
month:

<img src="../images/storm-record-by-month.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Although it is close, ***August*** holds the “record” for most storm
records in a month with April and May having the least amount of
records. From the plot, we can see that storms do not often occur
uniformly throughout year.

-----

We now refer to this mapping of the trajectories of all storm records
throughout the given
years:

<img src="../images/map-all-storms.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note that most storm records had occured around the area between North
and South America and in between Africa, Asia, and Austrailia. Areas
furthest from the equator such as Antartica, the upper portion of North
America, and Europe have the least amount of storm occurrences around
them.

In addition, we find that the ***South Atlantic Basin*** has the least
amount of storm occurences while the ***Western Pacific Basin*** has the
most. This observation coincides with what we have in our
**basin-frequencies** text file.

-----

The next two graphs are a direct comparison between storms in the
Eastern Pacific region and the North Atlantic region. *As a sidenote
provided by Professor Sanchez, it is informative to know that the North
Atlantic and Eastern Pacific are overlapping boundaries that allow
storms to make landfall and move inland without crossing basins.* We
determine a *basin change* only if the storm emerges over the opposite
ocean.

Let us then refer to the graph storm records around the Eastern Pacific
boundaries and the North Atlantic boundaries (both by year and by
month):

<img src="../images/map-ep-na-storms-by-year.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<img src="../images/map-ep-na-storms-by-month.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

As we can see from the graphs that are ***facetted by year***, the
Eastern Pacific and North Atlantic boundaries indeed partly cover one
another with storm colors being grouped together to exhibit their
occurence from opposite oceans. Likewise, if we refer to the graphs that
are ***facetted by month***, we notice storms in both these regions
occur less often during the winter/spring (so much as not at all during
February, March, and April) and more often during the summer.

-----

Lastly, we turn our attention to a further graph that plots a
correlection between pressure and wind values of all
storms:

<img src="../images/wind_speed_pressure.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

As we can see, there is a negative correlation between pressure values
and wind values with each storm type having hardly any outliers. It is
interesting to also note that certain storm types tend to clump over a
small radius of pressure and wind values (DS and ET).

-----

**Conclusion:** While not every detailed observation of the storms were
made, I showed various findings that are not easily shown from the raw
data we were given. By playing around with this data and making astute
observations on what I’ve manipulated, we can find information about
data-intensive topics, such as storms, very accesible and readible for a
more general audience.
